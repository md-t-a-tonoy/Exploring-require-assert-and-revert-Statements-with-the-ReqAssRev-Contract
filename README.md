#Understanding Solidity: Exploring require, assert, and revert Statements with the ReqAssRev Contract

```markdown
# ReqAssRev Contract

## Description
The `ReqAssRev` contract is a Solidity smart contract that serves as an illustrative example of the usage of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements in Solidity programming. It features three distinct functions that demonstrate the different behaviors of these statements.

## Prerequisites
- Solidity version: >=0.7.0 <0.9.0

## Functions

### requireExample
```solidity
function requireExample(uint256 num) external pure
```
This function takes a `num` parameter of type `uint256` and utilizes a `require` statement to validate whether the number is greater than 10. If the condition evaluates to false, the function reverts with an error message: "Number must be greater than 10".

### assertExample
```solidity
function assertExample(uint256 num) external pure
```
The `assertExample` function accepts a `num` parameter of type `uint256` and employs an `assert` statement to verify if the result of multiplying `num` by 2 is non-zero. If the condition evaluates to false, indicating an unexpected state, the contract execution is halted, and any modifications made are reverted.

### revertExample
```solidity
function revertExample(uint256 num) external pure
```
The `revertExample` function takes a `num` parameter of type `uint256` and invokes the `revert` function, which consistently reverts the transaction execution while supplying a specified error message. In this context, the error message reads: "This function always reverts".

## Solidity Version
The contract is compatible with Solidity version >=0.7.0 <0.9.0. Ensure that you use a Solidity compiler that is compatible with this version range for deploying or interacting with the contract.

## Usage
This contract is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the behaviors of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements in Solidity. It can be deployed and interacted with on a compatible Ethereum network or a local development environment.
